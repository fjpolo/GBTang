## nes2img tool instructions for nestang <= 0.6

The `tools/nes2img.py` python program can be used to convert .nes ROM files to an .img file. Ensure that you have Python version 3.7 or higher, and then install the Pillow package using `pip3 install pillow`. You can then use an SD imaging tool such as [Balena Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher) to burn the newly created image onto the MicroSD card.
